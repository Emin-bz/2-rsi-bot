# RSI Trading Bot

This is a simple cryptocurrency trading bot built in Python that uses the **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** as its primary indicator. The bot connects to a cryptocurrency exchange (e.g., Binance) via the **CCXT** library and makes trades based on RSI levels, aiming to buy in oversold conditions and sell in overbought conditions.

## Introduction

This bot is designed as an educational tool for those interested in automated trading. It uses the **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**, a momentum-based indicator, to generate buy and sell signals. When the RSI falls below a certain level, it suggests the asset may be oversold, triggering a buy signal. Conversely, if the RSI rises above a threshold, it may be overbought, leading to a sell signal.

## Features

- Calculates the RSI based on a configurable period (default: 14)
- Generates buy and sell signals based on customizable RSI thresholds
- Connects to multiple crypto exchanges via the CCXT library
- Simple and easy-to-understand code, suitable for beginners

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `ccxt` library (Install with `pip install ccxt`)

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install the required Python package:

    ```bash
    pip install ccxt
    ```

## Configuration

1. Open the bot script (`rsi_bot.py`).
2. Enter your exchange API keys:

    ```python
    API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
    API_SECRET = "YOUR_API_SECRET"
    ```

3. Customize trading parameters as needed:
    - **symbol**: The trading pair to use, e.g., `'BTC/USDT'`
    - **rsi_period**: Period for the RSI calculation (default is 14)
    - **overbought** and **oversold**: RSI levels to trigger sell and buy signals, respectively
    - **trade_amount**: Amount to buy or sell per trade

## How It Works

1. The bot fetches recent historical prices for the chosen trading pair.
2. It calculates the RSI based on the specified period.
3. It generates a **buy** signal if the RSI falls below the oversold threshold and a **sell** signal if it rises above the overbought threshold.
4. The bot places market orders based on the signal, holding if neither threshold is reached.

## Usage

1. Run the bot:

    ```bash
    python rsi_bot.py
    ```

2. Monitor the console output for **buy**, **sell**, and **hold** signals.

3. The bot checks for trading signals every 60 seconds.
